Cursor Highlight
================

A program for OS X that draws a white ring around the cursor position
to make it easier to find it on screen.


Why?
====

Because it makes life just a little bit nicer, especially when you
leave the cursor over text edit with a background color that doesn't
invert to something very different from the color of the cursor
itself.
